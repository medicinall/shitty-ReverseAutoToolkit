#  ReverseAutoToolkit

**ReverseAutoToolkit** is a lightweight and experimental reverse engineering automation script built with Python and Radare2 (`r2pipe`). Its purpose is to assist in the rapid triage of binary executables, making it easier to extract and analyze information like strings, encoded data, and function behaviors ‚Äî all without needing a full GUI RE environment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This toolkit is intentionally minimal and exploratory. It‚Äôs meant for quick insights, not full decompilation or production-grade analysis.

## Features & Utilities

ReverseAutoToolkit provides the following utilities:

- **Radare2 integration** via `r2pipe` for automated static analysis
- **String extraction** from within the binary
- **Encoded data detection** (Base64, ROT13, XOR heuristics)
- **Function scanning** to identify and dump suspicious or unique logic
- **Prints output** in human-readable format for reverse engineers and CTF solvers
- **Basic decoding attempts** on suspicious-looking string content
